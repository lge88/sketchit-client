1. Overview:
	SketchIT is an event handle engine for javacript applications. It maps user input event to a command output, which can be further used by command pattern based applications. 
	
	It supports:
		- traditional mouse and keyboard events;
		- tablet touch events, including multi-touch events;
		- single stroke sketch events;
		
	It is going to support: 
		- multi-stroke sketch events;
		- ?

2. Initialize:
	Load sketchit.js, then use:	
		controller = new SketchIT();
	or 	controller = new SketchIT(config);

3. Configuration: 
	You can use a configure object to do the configuration when initializing, you can also use configure() method to do that later:
		controller.configure(config);
		
	Available configurations: 
	
	- enable_multi_stroke : boolean
		Default is false.
	- multi_stroke_dt : number
		If the time interval between two strokes is larger that the value, the system will consider it as two single stroke. 
		Unit is millisecond, default is 500.
	- hold_dt : number
		the time interval threshold for the hold gesture. Unit is millisecond, default is 500.

	Example:
		controller.configure({
			enable_multi_stroke: true,
			multi_stroke_dt: 800,
			hold_dt: 500
		
		});

4. Public properties:
	
	- pressedKey : object
	- howManyFingers: number
	- pageX : number
	- pageY : number
	- startX : number
	- startY : number
	- pageX : number
	- pageY : number
		


5. Public functions:

	- map()
		Use the map() method to map the events:
			controller.map(event_map);
		
		The event map object event_map has different configurations due to
